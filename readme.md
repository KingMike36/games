# ðŸŽ® Basils Game Archive

All of the games from gbasil.dev archived in one place, plus some *extras* I was too lazy to push to the site.

## How to play

Download the zip file containing all of the files and folders. Extract the zip to a folder. Then, pick a game, go into its folder and open the index.html in your web browsing application of preference. Most games run offline, but games in the `gamepix` and `gamedist.com` folders require internet.
